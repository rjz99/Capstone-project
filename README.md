# Capstone-project
Transcriptomic Signatures Associated with Outcomes in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

Aim:
1. Identify differentially expressed transcripts associated with PAH disease severity
2. Understand the molecular pathways linked to clinically meaningful PAH outcomes
3. Highlight common pathways that contribute to PAH 

The data file contains the original Seattle Right Ventricle Translational Science (Servetus) Study data and our processed data. 

We fitted a negative binomial model to identify the differentially expressed transcripts associated with 3-year mortality and RV dilation.    

Details of our methods and results can be found in the final report and the slides covers our main takeaways and insights from this analysis.
